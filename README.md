# watcher

Installation:

```
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/terminusfoundation/watcher/master/install.sh)
```

Currently, there are two installers. install.sh and install-next.sh, the next is supposed to be used
when we have phinx migrations, a config file and the preflight check script.

Todo:

 - provide a gui to add sites and filter rules
 - store the filter rules in mysql
 - provide a gui to show site diffs
 - show per-user changes that happened since last login & look at the sites
 - add phinx database mirgration file
